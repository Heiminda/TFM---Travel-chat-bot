Would recommend for a business traveller who doesn't mind being a little bit further from the action of the old city.\", u\"We spent 3 nights at this Hotel Catalonia with two other couples. Liked the location and pool best. It's in the upper area of the city in the Puxtet neighborhood, a nice, quiet, middle/high middle class area with great quality restaurants, local businesses, services and viewing points north of the hotel. Underground train station within a couple blocks and buses...\", u\"The hotel definitely isn't a 4 stars, but has friendly staff and large rooms if you use a double for a single occupancy. Pros: supportive staff, quiet area. Cons: hard to find without car, average breakfast (no vegetables), the sheets were more gray, than white and the air condition is noisy. The smoking area is in front of the hotel,...\", u'Stayed 2 nights pre and post a cruise from Barelona\\nStaff freindly and helpful\\nThe hotel is quiet and in a mainly residential area of the city.

Standard rooms small - plain - smelly.\\nUpgrade was the omly answer for 30 euro a night.\\nWalls very thin and a lot of noise.\\nStaff very frendly and helpful. Food in the hotel about average.\\nMetro station about 5min walk awayand then 10min to the city centre.\\nWould i go back ? Definately Not.', u'The hotel is located conveniently in a quieter area of Barcelona, without being far out. The rooms are modern and clean, and the staff was friendly. The breakfast was delicious with lots of warm choices in addition to the spread of cold cereals, fruits, cheeses, and meats. For a treat, try to get one of the 2 rooms on the...', u'Hotel overall fairly nice. Average rooms and service. Good and cheap breakfast for 10 Euros. Free WiFi. Got the room for 90 Euros for one night. Overall good value. Mutaner Street has tons of traffic. Noise level fairly high. Not good if you seek a quiet hotel.', u'Apart from the fact that should not have been consindered as a 4 star, but rather a 3 star hotel, there are some other points I would like to refer to, based on my recent unpleasant visit to this hotel. The only reason for writing this review is that I believe this hotel is an insult towards customers and travellers....', u'My colleage forgot her passport at a money exchange in the city. We could not remember fthe place. A young lady receptionist at the hotel went out of her way to locate a branch of a sports shop closest to the money changer so that we could retrieve the passport. |The service was second to none.

The bathroom also spacious but smelly due...', u'This is the first time I am held as a hostage in a hotel.\\nWe were there as a football team participating in Barcelona Cup and I am one of the coaches. We stayed there 7 days. On the 4th day a wardrobe door fell from the wardrobe (a sliding piece of glass with a frame is the door) and...', u'The worst hotel I have ever been!!!! Apart from being clean, there is nothing good about it. The service at the bar is bad, if you want to order something the front reception must call someone from the kitchen downstairs to come and serve the people and then go downstairs again. At the restaurant, the food was OK but if...', u\"This is our last night here as apart of eftours and ii must say it's great. Breakfast and dinner are delectable.
